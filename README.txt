hello !!  

I started learning C++ a couple of mounts ago and i made this application as my first project.  I know it's trash compared to other projects and that it can be done in much better ways, the whole project idea was about making a virtual assistant like google assistant or Alexa.  

This app is just as simple as putting the questions in an array and the answers in an array, and if the app don't know the answer to the question it will ask you for a suggestion of the question, for now i could not manage to put the answers and questions in a file and save them separately so when you close the app all the info the you added will just go (BTW i made it in only 3 hours in total and i know that's a lot for such a simple app)  

One of the problems i found with this app is that the user can't input spaces in the answers or questions i don't know the reason but i am sure it's really easy to solve.  And i am thinking of adding a text to speak library and speak to text to make it more like an actual virtual assistant (i know there are apps like this already i just want to make my own version).  

I know this is kinda disappointing but i am really proud of what i have done so far, i hope you like it. of course i only posted this app to get suggestions from people to help improve my self in the future.
