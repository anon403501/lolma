hello !!

I started learning C++ a couple of mounths ago and i made this application as my first project.

I know it's trash compared to other projects and that it can be done in much better ways, the whole project idea was about making a virtual assitant like google assitant or alexa.

This app is just as semple as putting the questions in an array and the answers in an array, and if the app don't know the answer to the question it will ask you for a suggesion of the question, for now i could not manage to put the answers and questions in a file and save them separatly so when you close the app all the info the you added will just go (BTW i made it in only 3 hours in total and i know that's alot for such a simple app)

One of the problems i found with this app is that the user can't input spaces in the answers or questions i don't know the reason but i am sure it's really easy to solve.

And i am thinking of adding a text to speak library and speak to text to make it more like an actual virtual assistant and in the futere i would like to go online with this app to let everyone colaberate in it (i know there are apps like this already i just want to make my own version).

I know this is kinda dissapointing but i am really proud of what i have done so far, i hope you like it.
of course i only posted this app to get suggesions from people to help improve my self in the future.
